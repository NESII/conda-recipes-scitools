    # On OSX We need to effectively pin the geos version to the
    # one used by the specific shapely being targetted (we're letting
    # conda's package solver will deal with that).

    # owslib is not a build dependency, but it exists as a recipe and
    # should be built before cartopy for cartopy testing. Obvious-ci
    # should be extended to resolve this issue in the future.
